# Next data science area which I was interested in related to the topic of finance. When it comes to investing money many advices
center around investments into ETF (i.e. exhange traded funds vs. e.g. single stocks). Therefore I wanted to get a better 
# understanding on the varity of ETS and their historical developments. 

# In a very first step it is always about getting data on the topic of interest, in this case ETF. One source is e.g. the library pandas
# which contains many so-called data readers. After some Google search I deccided to use the package investpy which basically retrieves data
# from investing.com.
